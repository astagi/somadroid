# Somadroid

Free and light SomaFM Client for Android phones.

This code is imported from Google Code, I wrote it a long time ago (2010), it looks ugly, buggy and incompleted
but it's still my first Android app :) 

## Description
You can listen to your favorite channels, searching your favorite songs in Amazon or Google 
and reading djs biographies (this feature will be present in the 1.0 stable ). 
At the moment Somadroid is still in BETA version, so you may find bugs or not implemented features..
